"""
The Queue, SimpleQueue and JoinableQueue types are multi-producer, multi-consumer FIFO queues modelled on the queue.Queue class in the standard library. They differ in that Queue lacks the task_done() and join() methods introduced into Python 2.5â€™s queue.Queue class.
If you use JoinableQueue then you must call JoinableQueue.task_done() for each task removed from the queue or else the semaphore used to count the number of unfinished tasks may eventually overflow, raising an exception.
